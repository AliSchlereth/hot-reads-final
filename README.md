# HotReads

This is an app for tracking links you'd like to read as well as whether or not you have read them.
Visit in production: [https://quiet-cliffs-23046.herokuapp.com/](https://quiet-cliffs-23046.herokuapp.com/)

# How to install

### First: 
Pick your favorite directory, then:

`git clone https://github.com/AliSchlereth/hot-reads-final.git`

`cd hot-reads-final`

### Second: 
Run `bundle`. You'll need to be using Ruby 2.3.0.

### Third:
Now, you'll need to make sure your PostgreSQL database is running. If you've got

a small elephant at the top of your screen: great. If not, spin up your PostgreSQL app.

(If you don't have the app, go [here](http://postgresapp.com/) and follow the install instructions.)

### Fourth:
Next: run the following command in your terminal:

`rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare`

### Fifth: 
 Go ahead and run `rspec` - make sure all the

tests pass. If not, you might be missing a gem or maybe you should go back and run

`rake db:test:prepare` 

### Sixth:  
Run the app locally 
`rails s`
Visit
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
